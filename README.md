# Dracula Palette Converter
The Dracula Palette Converter is a web application that allows users to upload their favorite images/wallpapers and transform them to match the iconic [Dracula theme](https://draculatheme.com/). 

This tool first converts the image to [Grayscale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale) and then colorizes each black, white and mid colored pixel to the respective color of Dracula's palette, making your images consistent with the Dracula theme.

Made for [Hack Club's High Seas](https://github.com/hackclub/high-seas) !!
